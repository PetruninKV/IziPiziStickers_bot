My first python project. Telegram bot.

This Telegram bot helps users create their own custom stickers. The bot takes user images and converts them into .png format that has no background and doesn't exceed 512x512 resolution - these are the necessary requirements for creating stickers. All that's left for you to do is to forward the resulting file to @Stickers.
